        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <img src="images/Menacing.jpeg" alt="a funny yet scary photo of Mackenzie"width="500">

        <p> My name is Mackenzie Durocher and I am a student in the graphic design program. I come from a background of illustration, concept art, and animation. I have also dabbled in brand managing for small contracts. however, I really enjoy studying graphic design as it feels I can make a living with my skills. Coming from the illustration and concept art program I felt that I had alot of talent; however with the heavy work load I felt that talen when no whereThe encouragement I have recieved makes me want to keep going.</p>

        <p> This is one of my favourite photos of myself as it is so funny yet fits my personality very well. I am quirky, intense while having a commical flare. I truly hope I can demonstrate my personality in my art aswell. Outside of my career I enjoy video games, photography, and music. I am self-taught in piano, kalimba, pan flute and most recently ocarina. I really like niche instruments. </p>
